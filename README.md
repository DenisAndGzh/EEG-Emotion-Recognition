# EEG Emotion Recognition

## Introduction

This is a project of "Neurotechnology and Affective Computing" course for the third year in university.  

## Setup And Run

In order to run the code you need to request the [Seed Dataset](https://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/home/seed/seed.html), you need to apply for it, download the dataset and copy the SEED folder of the dataset to the root directory.  

## Project Objectives

In this project we will use EEG signals for emotion recognition. Through different kinds of classifiers, analyze their accuracy and performance and draw conclusions.  
After that, We will use the trained model to build the application.

## Experimental Equipment and Datasets

EEG Equipment: Open BCI 16 channels  
Datasets: Seed
